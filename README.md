## Introduction

This project focuses on implementing a simplified version of a blockchain database for storing student grades obtained in a semester. A block is created for each semester, and each block contains the information of the previous block, thus creating a chain of blocks. Each block contains a hash code that ensures data immutability, meaning that no one can modify the block's data without getting noticed. This project is aimed at providing a basic understanding of how a blockchain database works and how it can be implemented.

## Instructions for Running the Program  <br><br>
```
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Navigate to the project directory and run the blockchain.py file.
The program will read the input data from the input.txt file provided in the directory.
The program will generate a blockchain containing all the blocks corresponding to the semester data in the input.txt file.
The generated blockchain will be printed to the console as per the specified format.
